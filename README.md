Compact WPF-Appliction called "UTO - Untitled Tab Opener"

- Start Program
- Choose Browser
- Define URLs
- Click Open

And guess what.... The application opens the urls in the selected browser.
The Killer-Feature is that the application reminds your settings!* WHHHHAAAT?

*Do not delete "settings.unt"

The only thing that isn't totally mindblowing, is the design, but I am working on it ;-)
